An unnamed party of five adventurers - **Kilubash** (a Half-Orc Barbarian), **Margaret** (an Aasimar Paladin), **Myastan Sora** (a Dragonborn Sorcerer), and **Varis** (an Elf Wizard) - begin with a contract to escort a cargo to Phandalin for a dwarf named **Gundren Rockseeker**.

The party of adventurers travelled south from Neverwinter along the High Road, turning off to follow the Triboar trail east towards Phandalin. Along the way, they are ambushed by a band of goblins. They followed the goblin's tracks to the source, leading to a cavern. They fought through the cavern, defeating the Golbin's bugbear leader - Klarg - and rescuing **Sildar Hallwinter**, a wounded warrior of the Lord's Alliance who had been travelling with **Gundren Rockseeker**.
