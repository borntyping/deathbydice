* Advancement is done using milestones rather than XP.
* Encumbrance is not used.
* Hit points use a homebrew variant rule. Roll hit point dice as usual, but use the higher of your roll and the average roll (as with everything else, round down). Example: when rolling d8, a roll of 2 becomes 4, a roll of 7 stays 7.
* Ability scores should use point buy (with 27 points).
* Multiclassing is not used. Occasional exceptions are made for plot reasons.
* Additional sourcebooks are allowed. It's suggested but not required that you keep to the Player's Handbook plus one additional sourcebook, based on the rule used for the D&D Adventurer's League.
