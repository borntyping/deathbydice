* Advancement is done using milestones rather than XP.
* Encumbrance is not used.
* Used the fixed hit point value for your class.
* Ability scores should use point buy (with 27 points).
* Multiclassing is not used. Occasional exceptions are made for plot reasons.
* Additional sourcebooks are allowed. It's suggested but not required that you keep to the Player's Handbook plus one additional sourcebook, based on the rule used for the D&D Adventurer's League.
