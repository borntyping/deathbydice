Characters can be built from any offical D&D 5E rulebooks, excluding content from outside the Forgotten Realms (such as Eberron). 
In most adventures characters should use content from the Player's Handbook plus one additional book - though this is a guideline, not a rule.

* Initial ability scores use point buy (with 27 points).
* Characters use the "Milestone" advancement type.
* Characters use the fixed hit point value for their class.
* The optional multiclassing and encumbrance rules are not used.
