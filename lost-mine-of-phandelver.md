# Lost Mine of Phandelver

## Cragmore Cavern

*20th Kythorn 1493DR*

An unnamed party of five adventurers - **Kilubash** (a Half-Orc Barbarian), **Margaret** (an Aasimar Paladin), **Myastan Sora** (a Dragonborn Sorcerer), **Varis** (an Elf Wizard) and **Viscomtesse Ecureuil Roux** (a Gnome Ranger) - begin with a contract to escort a cargo to Phandalin for a dwarf named **Gundren Rockseeker**.

The party of adventurers travelled south from Neverwinter along the High Road, turning off to follow the Triboar trail east towards Phandalin. Along the way, they are ambushed by a band of goblins. They followed the goblin's tracks to the source, leading to a cavern. They fought through the cavern, defeating the Golbin's bugbear leader - Klarg - and rescuing **Sildar Hallwinter**, a wounded warrior of the Lord's Alliance who had been travelling with **Gundren Rockseeker**.

## Phandalin

*21st Kythorn 1493DR*

The party arrived at Phandalin, with Sildar Hallwinter not yet recovered and Myastan Sora fallen ill. A payment of 50gp was collected from **Elmar Barthen** for delivery of their cargo, after which the party decided to find an inn to stay at. They heard several rumors, mostly about the **Redbrands**, a gang shaking down local businesses.

They explored the town a little, where they met **Sister Garaele**, a zealous young elf, at the Shrine of Luck. She asked the party to bring a banshee named **Agatha** a gift of a jeweled silver comb and persuade her to tell what she knows about the location of a spellbook belonging to a legendary mage named **Bowgentle**. A payment of three *potions of healing* was offered.

Margaret, Varis and Roux went to see **Harbin Wester**, the Townmaster, at his hall with Sildar Hallwinter. Inquiries about the Redbrands were dismissed as "not all that much trouble, really‚Äù; but the townmaster offered 100gp for the group to "take care of" a group of orcs at *Wyvern Tor* (a few days west of Phandalin). After their meeting with the townmaster, Sildar Hallwinter spoke to him to announce that he would be setting up at the Townmaster's Hall as an agent of the Lords' Alliance with a goal of bringing law and order to Phandalin. He offered the party 500gp to locate *Cragmore Castle* and defeat or drive off the goblin cheftain there.

While that was happening, Kilubash decided to find the town's tap house - _The Sleeping Giant_ - which was rumoured to be a frequent drinking spot of Redbrand ruffians. A few of them were lounging by the doors of the inn, and a fight started within moments when they insulted Kilubash. Varis' familiar, currently in cat form, ran back to the others to get help, but by the time they arrived Kilubash was gone, and a note pinned to the table in the now empty tap house instructed them to come unarmed to _Tresendar Manor_ at midnight to get him back.

Margaret, Varis and Roux headed towards Tresendar Manor as soon as it got dark, where the found an entrace to the cellars and crypts below the ruins of the manor. Low on health and resources, they snuck in, carefully making their way around a pit trap. A trio of skeleton guardians left all but Varis unconscious, who found Kilubash and a family from Phandalin held prisoner by the Redbrands in the next room. He used _Tensor's Floating Disk_ to carry the other party members, aiming to leave and find help for his companions. Unfortunately, the pit trap proved more dangerous the second time round, leaving him unconsious at the bottom...

## Tresendar Manor

_21st Kythorn 1493DR_

Late in the evening Sora - feeling much better after a days rest - was nervoursly encouraged by **Toblen Stonehill** (the proprietor of the Stonehill Inn) to take something for his health and go for a walk, maybe talk to Sildar. After being ushered out of the inn and talking to Sildar in the Townmaster's hall, he discovered that the others hadn't come back after heading towards Trensador Manor, hideout for the Redbrands.

Meanwhile, Varis miraculously recovered from his injuries and tried to escape the pit, and was given a hand up by **Iarno Albrek**, a wizard and leader of the Redbrands. Varis and other unconsious party members soon found themselves imprisoned in the cells they earlier rescued Kilubash from, and were soon joined by Sora when he tried to sneak into the manor's cellar and fell victim to the same pit trap. With the party all back together again, they took the chance to rest overnight.

_22nd Kythorn 1493D_

In the morning Roux set a trap for the gaurds using an illusion after earlier picking the locks on the cell doors. They jumped the guards when they came in, and proceded to explore the rest of the cellars. The cellars surrounded a ravine crossed by wooden bridges, and as they waled across they each heard a whispering voice searching through their head for secrets. They fought a room full of bugbears who were tormenting a small goblin, which did not survive after Varis filled the room with fire by casting _Burning Hands_. Another room recently occupied by more of the Redbrands who had been gambling was intimidated into leaving.

Finally, they came accross a wizards laboratory and bedroom, unoccupied save for a small rat - which was very unhelpful when Roux cast _Speak with Animals_, but no-one could decide if a rat would be capable of lying. The laboratory seemed to have been used to (unsuccessfully) create a _Potion of Invisibility_, and the bedroom had been hurriedly emptied, with clothes scattered across the floor. A note on the  desk descibed Iarno Albrek's orders, sent to him by someone using a name of **The Black Spider**.

There was no sign of Iarno Albrek himself, and while trying to leave  the party was delayed by a mind-reading **Nothic** who instructed them to stop - after several party members tried to work out what it was and decided that it was a very large cat. Following a tunnel that lead into the forest, they returned to the Stonehill Inn where they celebrated ridding the town of the Redbrands with some of the villagers, but couldn't help feeling they had missed something...
