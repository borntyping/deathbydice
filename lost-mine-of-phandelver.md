# Lost Mine of Phandelver

## Cragmore Cavern

*(2018-03-10)*

An unnamed party of five adventurers - **Kilubash** (a Half-Orc Barbarian), **Margaret** (an Aasimar Paladin), **Myastan Sora** (a Dragonborn Sorcerer), **Varis** (an Elf Wizard) and **Viscomtesse Ecureuil Roux** (a Gnome Ranger) - begin with a contract to escort a cargo to Phandalin for a dwarf named **Gundren Rockseeker**.

The party of adventurers travelled south from Neverwinter along the High Road, turning off to follow the Triboar trail east towards Phandalin. Along the way, they are ambushed by a band of goblins. They followed the goblin's tracks to the source, leading to a cavern. They fought through the cavern, defeating the Golbin's bugbear leader - Klarg - and rescuing **Sildar Hallwinter**, a wounded warrior of the Lord's Alliance who had been travelling with **Gundren Rockseeker**.

## Phandalin

*(2018-03-17)*

The party arrived at Phandalin, with Sildar Hallwinter not yet recovered and Myastan Sora fallen ill. A payment of 50gp was collected from **Elmar Barthen** for delivery of their cargo, after which the party decided to find an inn to stay at. They heard several rumors, mostly about the **Redbrands**, a gang shaking down local businesses.

They explored the town a little, where they met **Sister Garaele**, a zealous young elf, at the Shrine of Luck. She asked the party to bring a banshee named **Agatha** a gift of a jeweled silver comb and persuade her to tell what she knows about the location of a spellbook belonging to a legendary mage named **Bowgentle**. A payment of three *potions of healing* was offered.

Margaret, Varis and Roux went to see **Harbin Wester**, the Townmaster, at his hall with Sildar Hallwinter. Inquiries about the Redbrands were dismissed as "not all that much trouble, really‚Äù; but the townmaster offered 100gp for the group to "take care of" a group of orcs at *Wyvern Tor* (a few days west of Phandalin). After their meeting with the townmaster, Sildar Hallwinter spoke to him to announce that he would be setting up at the Townmaster's Hall as an agent of the Lords' Alliance with a goal of bringing law and order to Phandalin. He offered the party 500gp to locate *Cragmore Castle* and defeat or drive off the goblin cheftain there.

While that was happening, Kilubash decided to find the town's tap house - _The Sleeping Giant_ - which was rumoured to be a frequent drinking spot of Redbrand ruffians. A few of them were lounging by the doors of the inn, and a fight started within moments when they insulted Kilubash. Varis' familiar, currently in cat form, ran back to the others to get help, but by the time they arrived Kilubash was gone, and a note pinned to the table in the now empty tap house instructed them to come unarmed to _Tresendar Manor_ at midnight to get him back.

Margaret, Varis and Roux headed towards Tresendar Manor as soon as it got dark, where the found an entrace to the cellars and crypts below the ruins of the manor. Low on health and resources, they snuck in, carefully making their way around a pit trap. A trio of skeleton guardians left all but Varis unconscious, who found Kilubash and a family from Phandalin held prisoner by the Redbrands in the next room. He used _Tensor's Floating Disk_ to carry the other party members, aiming to leave and find help for his companions. Unfortunately, the pit trap proved more dangerous the second time round, leaving him unconsious at the bottom...
