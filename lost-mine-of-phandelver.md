# Lost Mine of Phandelver

## Cragmore Cavern

_20th Kythorn 1493DR; with Kilubash, Margaret, Roux, Sora, and Varis._

An unnamed party of five adventurers - **Kilubash** (a Half-Orc Barbarian), **Margaret** (an Aasimar Paladin), **Myastan Sora** (a Dragonborn Sorcerer), **Varis** (an Elf Wizard) and **Viscomtesse Ecureuil Roux** (a Gnome Ranger) - begin with a contract to escort a cargo to Phandalin for a dwarf named **Gundren Rockseeker**.

The party of adventurers travelled south from Neverwinter along the High Road, turning off to follow the Triboar trail east towards Phandalin. Along the way, they are ambushed by a band of goblins. They followed the goblin's tracks to the source, leading to a cavern. They fought through the cavern, defeating the Golbin's bugbear leader - Klarg - and rescuing **Sildar Hallwinter**, a wounded warrior of the Lord's Alliance who had been travelling with **Gundren Rockseeker**.

## Phandalin

_21st Kythorn 1493DR; with Kilubash, Margaret, Roux, and Varis._

The party arrived at Phandalin, with Sildar Hallwinter not yet recovered and Myastan Sora fallen ill. A payment of 50gp was collected from **Elmar Barthen** for delivery of their cargo, after which the party decided to find an inn to stay at. They heard several rumours, mostly about the **Redbrands**, a gang shaking down local businesses.

They explored the town a little, where they met **Sister Garaele**, a zealous young elf, at the Shrine of Luck. She asked the party to bring a banshee named **Agatha** a gift of a jewelled silver comb and persuade her to tell what she knows about the location of a spellbook belonging to a legendary mage named **Bowgentle**. A payment of three *potions of healing* was offered.

Margaret, Varis and Roux went to see **Harbin Wester**, the Townmaster, at his hall with Sildar Hallwinter. Inquiries about the Redbrands were dismissed as "not all that much trouble, really‚Äù; but the townmaster offered 100gp for the group to "take care of" a group of orcs at *Wyvern Tor* (a few days west of Phandalin). After their meeting with the townmaster, Sildar Hallwinter spoke to him to announce that he would be staying up at the Townmaster's Hall as an agent of the Lords' Alliance with a goal of bringing law and order to Phandalin. He offered the party 500gp to locate *Cragmore Castle* and defeat or drive off the goblin chieftain there.

While that was happening, Kilubash decided to find the town's tap house - _The Sleeping Giant_ - which was rumoured to be a frequent drinking spot of Redbrand ruffians. A few of them were lounging by the doors of the inn, and a fight started within moments when they insulted Kilubash. Varis' familiar, currently in cat form, ran back to the others to get help, but by the time they arrived Kilubash was gone, and a note pinned to the table in the now empty tap house instructed them to come unarmed to _Tresendar Manor_ at midnight to get him back.

Margaret, Varis and Roux headed towards Tresendar Manor as soon as it got dark, where the found an entrance to the cellars and crypts below the ruins of the manor. Low on health and resources, they snuck in, carefully making their way around a pit trap. A trio of skeleton guardians left all but Varis unconscious, who found Kilubash and a family from Phandalin held prisoner by the Redbrands in the next room. He used _Tensor's Floating Disk_ to carry the other party members, aiming to leave and find help for his companions. Unfortunately, the pit trap proved more dangerous the second time around, leaving him unconscious at the bottom...

## Tresendar Manor

_21st Kythorn 1493DR; with Kilubash, Margaret, Roux, Sora, and Varis._

Late in the evening Sora - feeling much better after a days rest - was nervously encouraged by **Toblen Stonehill** (the proprietor of the Stonehill Inn) to take something for his health and go for a walk, maybe talk to Sildar. After being ushered out of the inn and conversing with Sildar in the Townmaster's hall, he discovered that the others hadn't come back after heading towards Trensador Manor, the hideout for the Redbrands.

Meanwhile, Varis miraculously recovered from his injuries and tried to escape the pit, and was given a hand up by **Iarno Albrek**, a wizard and leader of the Redbrands. Varis and other unconscious party members soon found themselves imprisoned in the cells they earlier rescued Kilubash from and were soon joined by Sora when he tried to sneak into the manor's cellar and fell victim to the same pit trap. With the party all back together again, they took the chance to rest overnight.

_22nd Kythorn 1493D; with Kilubash, Margaret, Roux, Sora, and Varis._

In the morning Roux set a trap for the guards using an illusion after earlier picking the locks on the cell doors. They jumped the guards when they came in and proceeded to explore the rest of the cellars. The cellars surrounded a ravine crossed by wooden bridges, and as they walked across they each heard a whispering voice searching through their head for secrets. They fought a room of bugbears who were tormenting a small goblin, which did not survive after Varis filled the room with fire by casting _Burning Hands_. Another room recently occupied by more of the Redbrands who had been gambling was intimidated into leaving.

Finally, they came across a wizard's laboratory and bedroom, unoccupied save for a small rat - which was very unhelpful when Roux cast _Speak with Animals_, but no-one could decide if a rat would be capable of lying. The laboratory seemed to have been used to (unsuccessfully) create a _Potion of Invisibility_, and the bedroom had been hurriedly emptied, with clothes scattered across the floor. A note on the desk described Iarno Albrek's orders, sent to him by someone using a name of **The Black Spider**.

There was no sign of Iarno Albrek himself, and while trying to leave the party was delayed by a mind-reading **Nothic** who instructed them to stop - after several party members tried to work out what it was and decided that it was a very large cat. Following a tunnel that leads into the forest, they returned to the Stonehill Inn where they celebrated ridding the town of the Redbrands with some of the villagers, but couldn't help feeling they had missed something...

## The Triboar Trail

_23rd-25th Kythorn 1493D; with Kilubash, Margaret, Sora, and Varis._

With no leads to follow on Iarno Albrek or Cragmore Castle, the party of adventurers set off along the Triboar Trail to complete various requests from the people of Phandelver.

First, they dealt with Sister Garaele's request to visit the banshee Agatha and delivered the jewelled comb in exchange for to the answer to a question. They asked about Bowgentle's spellbook, and Agatha told them that she traded the book to a necromancer named Tsernoth from the city of Iriaebor more than a hundred years ago, before disappearing.

Next, they visited Old Owl Well at the request of **Daran Edermath**, a retired paladin. There they found the ancient ruins of a forgotten empires watchtower, occupied by a necromancer - **Hamun Kost** and his zombies. The adventures spoke with him when he called off his zombies from attacking, and Hamun requested that the party ask a question of Agatha ("What is the name of the wizard who built the tower at Old Owl Well?" - but the adventurers know she may not appear to answer the second question) and that they remove the orc scouting party at Wyvern Tor.

They headed south to Wyvern Tor, encountering a huge ogre along the way, before making camp as the sun set on their third day on the Triboar Trail.

## Wyvern Tor

_25rd-28th Kythorn 1493DR; with Kilubash, Margaret, Sora, and Varis._

As the party awoke, they were greeted by a voice speaking to them from nowhere. It told them that it was disappointed they dismissed it's earlier hospitality, but had decided to try again and bring them the gift of friendship - it had alerted the Orc scouting party they had been searching for to their location! If they survived, it continued, the party of adventurers would find it in Cragmore Castle. It stopped speaking as the war cries of the Orcs started to reach them from a nearby summit, the start of a battle in which they slew may orcs and an ogre.

After the battle, they headed back to Phandelver and travelled relatively peacefully. Once back at the village, they returned to many of the people who had given them quests to collect their reward and picked up a new thread from the proprietor of the local inn which directed them north to Thundertree to speak with a druid who should know where Cragmore Castle or Wave Echo cave might be.

## Ruins of Thundertree

_29th Kythorn - 2nd Flamerule 1493DR; with Kilubash, Margaret, and Varis._

From Phandevler the party set off for the ruins of Thundertree, visiting **Neverwinter** on their way. In the city, Margaret stayed at the barracks of their holy order, while Kilubash and Varis found board at a local tavern. In the morning they visited **Syndra Silvane**, a bedridden merchant who originally directed them towards the job to escort goods to Phandelver. She encouraged them to continue to search for Gundren, and so the party chartered a boat to take them upriver - after spending some time shopping.

In **Thundertree** they soon found the ruined house that the druid Riedroth lived in, where they sat down for tea. The druid warned them of the dangers in Thundertree - plants, zombies, dragons and cultists - before answering their questions on the location of Cragmore Castle.

Leaving the house, our adventurers continued to explore Thundertree and headed to the ruined apothecary where they knew an expensive heirloom was stashed. They found it and headed to the tower on the hill. Noting the mauled spiders on the path outside, they bravely continued inside, passing through the empty cottage into the tower proper - where they were faced by the _Young Green Dragon_ **Venomfang**. Margaret started asking questions as the others backed away, leading Venomfang to complain about being awoken from its slumber. She offered it the jewellery they had recently recovered, and it decided to allow them to leave. The adventurers did not take its advice.

Venomfang started to move, trapping Margret in the room (and stopping Varis' attempt to silently steal a book from its hoard using _Mage Hand_). Varis cast _Fog Cloud_, stopping Margaret from seeing the dragon, while she cast _Sanctuary_ and started trying to break a hole in the wall to escape. The dragons coils allowed entry to the tower for a moment, so Varis and Kilubash ran inside to attack it - Kilubash cleaved a gash in the side of the dragon with his new greataxe, and finally attacked, Venomfang retaliated.

The green dragon roared and spewed acid breath at Margaret, drenching every creature in the small room. Margaret and Mouse (Varis' familiar) were instantly killed, while Kilubash and Varis fell unconscious. They stabilised a few moments later but were never heard from again.
