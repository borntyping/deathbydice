# Tomb of Annhilation

> For the past several days, the talk of the streets and taverns has all been about the so-called death curse: a wasting disease afflicting people who have been raised from the dead. Victims grow thinner and weaker each day, slowly but steadily sliding toward the death they once denied.

## Before the campagain starts

Players have a few things to do before the campaign starts:

* [Create a character on D&D Beyond][beyond-toa]
* [Answer questions on game mechanics][mechanics]
* [Answer questions on your character][characters]

As a group, we'll also work out the details of the party and the company they work for.
