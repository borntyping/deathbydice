Age of Ashes
============

Hellnight Hill
--------------

During **Breechill**'s monthly call Call for Heros we pledged to help the **Bumblebrasher** tribe, whose distress signals rose from the nearby **Citadel Altaerein**.
The Call for Heros was interrupted by a fire, after which witnesses described **Calmont Trenault** summoning a fire mephit and setting fire to the building.
We later encountered Calmont at Citadel Altaerein where he was holding a goblin hostage, and talked about searching for **Alseta's Ring**.
The Bumblebrashers had been displaced from the lower levels of the Citadel, and were unable to return.
Calmont was captured and returned to Breechill to stand trial, and the Bumblebrashers made camp in the forest nearby.

After Calmont's trial we tried to find **Voz Lirayne**, owner of the Reliant Book Company.
We found a note inside her trapped office, describing the entrance to Alseta's Ring under **Gaurdian's Way**.
Gaurdian's Way consists of three treetop platforms in the woods make for the Goblinblood Wars.

In Voz' bedroom, we found a book named _Breehill: Outpost of Liberty_ and her notes with negative comments on Breechill's history.
Breechill's well-known history is that a powerful wizard named **Lamond Breachton** helped a small outpost of human amnesiacs turn into a thriving town.
The notes describe an alternative, in which Lamond Breachton founded Breechill after a failed attempt to make a town named Utopia. 
He held Utopia's inhabitant's responsible for the town's failure, wiped their memories as punishment, and left.
Later he returned in guilt to help the now struggling settlement, and is now remembered fondly as the founder of Breechill.
